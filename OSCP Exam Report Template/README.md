# OSCP Exam Report Template
Modified template for the OSCP Exam. Used it during my passing attempt

**Notable Edits**

1. Updated version to 3.2
2. Updated the Table of Contents to reflect the new data flow of the document
3. Added more information to the High Level Summary
4. Updated 3.1 Information Gathering (For each machine, I create a link to the associated machine)
5. Updated the documentation flow. Each Machine is given its own section. Creates a boot to root walkthrough feel for each machine
6. Added the Service Enumeration table to each machine section instead of one table for the entire report
7. Added a header for Nmap scan results (screenshot)
8. Added headers for Local.txt Contents (the hash) and Local.txt Screenshot
9. Added headers for Proof.txt Contents and the Proof.txt Screenshot
10. Created a machine entry for the Buffer Overflow machine. 
11. Added Appendix 1 - Proof and Local Contents. This is an easy way to track those keys
12. Added Appendix 2 - Metasploit/Meterpreter Usage. If you use the allowance on the exam, this is an easy way to document it
13. Added Appendix 3 - Completed Buffer Overflow Code
